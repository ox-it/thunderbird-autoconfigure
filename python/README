Oxford Thunderbird Auto-configuration
=====================================

This repository provides oxtbac, a simple WSGI-compliant web application to serve configuration information to Thunderbird 3.1 clients.


Requirements
------------

oxtbac has a modest set of requirements:

 * IPy (for checking IP addresses against subnets)
 * dnspython (for checking MX records)
 * mod_wsgi (if serving with Apache HTTPD)

These have the following packaged names:

 * Debian: python-ipy python-dnspython libapache2-mod-wsgi
 * Fedora: python-IPy python-dns mod_wsgi
 * PyPI:   IPy dnspython


Installing
----------

As root, run:

$ python setup.py install

With a bit of jiggery-pokery you should be able to not install it machine-wide. To do this, edit the oxtbac.(wsgi|cgi) script to add the path to the module's parent directory to the Python path. This can be done by adding the following two lines somewhere near the top:

> import sys
> sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/this/directory/')

Running a test server
---------------------

Simply run test.py as a Python script, and point your web browser at http://localhost:8000/?emailaddress=firstname.lastname@unit.ox.ac.uk.


Serving using Apache and WSGI
-----------------------------

Include a modified version of example-apache.conf in your main Apache config or sites-enabled, and restart.

To test the site locally, add an entry in /etc/hosts mapping 127.0.0.1 or ::1 to autoconfig.unit.ox.ac.uk.

The WSGI application can also be included in an already-existing config by inserting the WSGIScriptAlias line.


Serving using Apache and CGI
----------------------------

This isn't preferred, but should be entirely functional.

Simply set the /cgi-bin/ as being a ScriptAlias on your VirtualHost, and Alias /mail/config-v1.1.xml to it.
